<p>GNU Trove: High performance collections for Java.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The GNU Trove library has two objectives:
<ol>

  <li>Provide &quot;free&quot; (as in &quot;free speech&quot;
    <i>and</i> &quot;free beer&quot;), fast, lightweight
    implementations of the <tt>java.util</tt> Collections API.
    These implementations are designed to be pluggable
    replacements for their JDK equivalents.
  </li>

  <li>Whenever possible, provide the same collections support
    for <strong>primitive</strong> types. This gap in the JDK is
    often addressed by using the &quot;wrapper&quot; classes
    (<tt>java.lang.Integer</tt>, <tt>java.lang.Float</tt>, etc.)
    with Object-based collections. For most applications,
    however, collections which store primitives directly will
    require less space and yield significant performance gains.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Hashtable techniques</h2>

<p>The Trove maps/sets use open addressing instead of the chaining
  approach taken by the JDK hashtables. This eliminates the need
  to create Map.Entry wrappper objects for every item in a
  table and so reduces the <tt>O</tt> (big-oh) in the performance of
  the hashtable algorithm. The size of the tables used in Trove's maps/sets is
  always a prime number, improving the probability of an optimal distribution
  of entries across the table, and so reducing the the likelihood
  of performance-degrading collisions. Trove sets are not
  backed by maps, and so using a THashSet does not result in
  the allocation of an unused "values" array.
</p>

<h2>Hashing strategies</h2>

<p>Trove's maps/sets support the use of custom <tt>hashing
  strategies</tt>, allowing you to tune collections based on
  characteristics of the input data. This feature also allows you
  to define hash functions when it is not feasible to override
  Object.hashCode(). For example, the java.lang.String class is
  final, and its implementation of hashCode() takes <tt>O(n)</tt>
  time to complete. In some applications, however, it may be
  possible for a custom hashing function to save time by skipping
  portions of the string that are invariant.</p>

<p>Using java.util.HashMap, it is not possible to use Java
  language arrays as keys. For example, this code:
<pre>
    char[] foo, bar;
    foo = new char[] {'a','b','c'};
    bar = new char[] {'a','b','c'};
    System.out.println(foo.hashCode() == bar.hashCode() ? "equal" : "not equal");
    System.out.println(foo.equals(bar) ? "equal" : "not equal");
    </pre>

produces this output:

<pre>
    not equal
    not equal
    </pre>

And so an entry stored in a java.util.HashMap with foo as a
key could not be retrieved with bar, since there is no way
to override hashCode() or equals() on language array objects.
</p>

<p>In a gnu.trove.THashMap, however, you can implement a TObjectHashingStrategy
  to enable hashing on arrays:

<pre>
    class CharArrayStrategy implements TObjectHashingStrategy {
        public int computeHashCode(Object o) {
            char[] c = (char[])o;
            // use the shift-add-xor class of string hashing functions
            // cf. Ramakrishna and Zobel, "Performance in Practice of String Hashing Functions"
            int h = 31; // seed chosen at random
            for (int i = 0; i < c.length; i++) { // could skip invariants
                h = h ^ ((h << 5) + (h >> 2) + c[i]); // L=5, R=2 works well for ASCII input
            }
            return h;
        }

        public boolean equals(Object o1, Object o2) {
            char[] c1 = (char[])o1;
            char[] c2 = (char[])o2;
            if (c1.length != c2.length) { // could drop this check for fixed-length keys
                return false;
            }
            for (int i = 0, len = c1.length; i < len; i++) { // could skip invariants
                if (c1[i] != c2[i]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
    }
    </pre>
</p>

<h2>Iterators in primitive collections</h2>

<p>As of release 0.1.7, Trove's primitive mappings include access through Iterators
  as well as procedures and functions. The API documentation on those classes
  contains several examples showing how these can be used effectively and
  explaining why their semantics differ from those of <tt>java.util.Iterator.</tt></p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>N.B. using <tt>Map.entrySet</tt> on a Trove Map is supported, but
  not encouraged. The reason is that this API requires the creation of
  the Map.Entry Objects that all other parts of Trove manage to avoid.
  An alternative is to implement the appropriate <tt>Procedure</tt>
  interface and use it to invoke the Map's <tt>forEachEntry</tt>
  API. <tt>Map.keySet</tt> and <tt>Map.values</tt> are not
  similarly encumbered; nevertheless, the <tt>forEachKey</tt>,
  <tt>forEachValue</tt>, and <tt>transformValues</tt> APIs will yield
  slightly better performance at the cost of compatibility with the
  interface of <tt>java.util.Map</tt>.</p>
