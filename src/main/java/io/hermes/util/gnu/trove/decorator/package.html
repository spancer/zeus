<p>GNU Trove: Decorators for java.util.{Map,Set} compatability</p>

<p>The classes in this package serve to wrap the Trove primitive
  collections so that they can be used in operations that require a
  <tt>java.util.Map</tt> or <tt>java.util.Set</tt>.</p>

<p>This is form of adaptation is <b>extremely</b> inefficient and
  so should only be undertaken as a last resort or when you don't
  care about performance (in which case Trove is probably not
  appropriate anyway).</p>

<p>The general pattern here is that you "wrap" a Trove collection
  with the appropriate decorator object to obtain a java.util.Map or
  Set. The implementations do not retain references to the Objects
  they accept/return (all calls are delegated to the underlying
  trove collection), so you should not rely on object identity
  within those collections.</p>

<p>You may extend the decorator classes to use canonical values if
  your dataset permits. For some applications, this will help
  reduce the cost of (un)wrapping primitive values. Note, however,
  that such datasets are probably small/restricted enough that you
  should again ask yourself whether Trove is appropriate in the
  first place. Caveat programmer.</p.
